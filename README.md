Examples and explanations about DesignPatterns.

## Structural Patterns

- [x] **Adapter** | Match interfaces of different classes
- [x] **Bridge** | Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
- [x] **Composite** | A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- [x] **Decorator** | Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- [x] **Facade** | A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- [x] **Flyweight** | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- [x] **Proxy** | An object representing another object

## Behavioral Patterns

- [x] **Chain of Resp.** | A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- [x] **Command** | Encapsulate a command request as an object
- [ ] **Interpreter** | A way to include language elements in a program
- [x] **Iterator** | Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- [x] **Mediator** | Defines simplified communication between classes
- [x] **Memento** | Capture and restore an object's internal state
- [x] **Observer** | A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- [x] **State** | Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- [x] **Strategy** | Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- [ ] **Template Method** | Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- [ ] **Visitor** | Defines a new operation to a class without change

## Creational Patterns

- [x]  **Factory** | Creates an instance of several families of classes
- [x]  **Builder** | Separates object construction from its representation
- [x]  **Factory** Method | Creates an instance of several derived classes
- [x]  **Prototype** | A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- [x]  **Singleton** | A class of which only a single instance can exist
